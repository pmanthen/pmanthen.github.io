    <h3>This page will document web application patterns that I found useful</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Website should have dynamically managed placeholders to display custom messages. 
      Example: Amazon may want to display days remaining to order for a delivery before Christamas</li>
    
    <li>
      If a website offers multiple features/services. There is a high chance that each service is provided by multiple backend systems.
      There is a high chance that any service in this echo system can go down / will go under maintenance.
      Hence, there should be a functionality to dynamically disable/enable services and gracefully manage user experience
    </li>
    <li>
      Error messaging: Each error user sees in the front end should have a unique error ID.
      When user contacts someone for help, there should be an easy way to pull everything that happened when user experienced that error.
      </li>
    </ul>
